    <string name="Info">The Ministry of War was one of the three ministries of the Sith Empire's government, and it was charged with overseeing the armed forces of the Empire. The Imperial Navy's fleet deployments, repairs, maintenance, and starfighter squadrons were all arranged and organized by the Ministry of War, and the Ministry also oversaw the Imperial Army: deployments, combat tactics, strategy, security, Special Forces operations, black ops missions, and the Imperial Reclamation Service were all under the control of the Ministry. The Ministry was headed by the Minister of War, who answered to three Dark Councilors: the heads of the Defense, Military Offense, and Military Strategy spheres. Beneath the Minister were the Moffs, who served as governors and military leaders who oversaw wide regions of Imperial space, and a strict chain of command was maintained to ensure the military discipline and efficiency that the Empire prided itself on.</string>
